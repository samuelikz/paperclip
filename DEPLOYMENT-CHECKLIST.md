### Automated Backup Cron Setup
```bash
# Install cron job — production: every 6 hours
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 */6 * * * PAPERCLIP_DIR=/opt/paperclip /opt/paperclip/scripts/backup-db-auto.sh >> /var/log/paperclip-backup.log 2>&1") | crontab -

# Or staging: once daily at 2 AM
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 2 * * * PAPERCLIP_DIR=/opt/paperclip /opt/paperclip/scripts/backup-db-auto.sh >> /var/log/paperclip-backup.log 2>&1") | crontab -

# Verify cron is installed
crontab -l
```

Configurable via environment variables in the cron line:
| Variable             | Default                         | Description                          |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `PAPERCLIP_DIR`      | Script parent directory         | Project root                         |
| `BACKUP_DIR`         | `$PAPERCLIP_DIR/backups`        | Where to store dump files            |
| `BACKUP_KEEP_COUNT`  | `14`                            | Number of backups to retain          |
| `DB_CONTAINER`       | `paperclip-db`                  | Postgres container name              |
| `VERIFY_BACKUP`      | `true`                          | Run integrity check after backup     |
| `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` | _(empty)_                       | Webhook URL to POST on failure       |
| `LOG_FORMAT`         | `json`                          | Log format: `json` or `text`         |
